    <h1>simply too perfect</h1>
  </body>  maybe i can feel ok being happy. 
  its not something i need to run from, or something that means impending doom.<br> its just good, and good doesnt mean the coming of bad, or a calmness before a storm. just because its fleeting doesnt mean i cant enjoy, opr bask in it. <br>
  i can let it be, i wont read in between the lines, i wont wonder whats under the surface, i wont wonder if im mistaken or missing something, i will be ok with things being perfectly good and fine, and i wont expect the end of this feeling until it hits me.
 <br> i will be ok being happy.
